# Full Stack PTDiary Application

 The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for HyperionDev final Capstone project, this platform provides a user-friendly  
 interface for efficient collaboration between trainer and client. This project inspired due to my personal struggle in keeping my fitness goal and a lack of platform that allow collaboration between personal trainer and a client. 
 The cloud based Personal trainer Diary Application (PTDiary) is designed for professional Personal trainers and clients. A personal trainer will be able to add and assign workout to their clients. 
 Clients will be able to only access the workout plan addressed to them.

#  Why/Problem?
 Personal trainers with multiple clients need to monitor client's fitness performance and assign each client with a workout plan. Traditional methods of tracking through spreadsheets or manual systems do not allow collaboration. The Cloud-Based 
 Personal trainer Diary Application aims to address these challenges by providing a centralised platform for workout plan, enabling creation of workout and assigning those workout to a specific client.
 The MERN stack ensures scalability, while the integration of Redux Toolkit, Headless UI, and CSS enhances user experience and performance.
